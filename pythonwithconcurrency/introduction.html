    <p id="01a3ecfa-0a1f-4656-9314-ba9139b14156" class="">The results are interesting and counterintuitive. We would expect the multithreaded scenario to perform better than the single-threaded one since two threads can work in parallel if the system has at least two CPUs. The relatively poor performance in comparison to the single-threaded scenario can be explained by (standard) Python&#x27;s Achillesâ€™ heel, the Global Interpreter Lock, an entity within the Python framework that allows a single thread to execute even in the presence of more than one idle CPUs.</p><p id="43421046-2273-4137-8a8b-e1d3abe7213e" class="">Multithreaded scenarios may not experience any performance gains in case of CPU-intensive tasks such as the one in our example because threads don&#x27;t execute in parallel and in fact incur an additional cost of management and coalescing partial results.</p><p id="72f1fccf-4edc-46e6-9a25-c6f1d2e1b21e" class="">With multiple processes we can expect each process to be scheduled onto a separate CPU and work in parallel. However, there&#x27;s the additional overhead of creating and tearing down processes, which is higher than doing the same for threads. Additionally, we utilize Python&#x27;s inter-process communication machinery, which uses the proxy-pattern and adds network latency to the multiprocessing scenario.</p><p id="f299e204-f022-47e1-a794-c77bdd4ae61b" class="">

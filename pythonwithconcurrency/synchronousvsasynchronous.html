An asynchronous program doesnâ€™t wait for a task to complete before moving on to the next task.</p><p id="2af9f05a-a536-48a9-b53d-51c073e63384" class="">In contrast to synchronous execution, asynchronous execution doesn&#x27;t necessarily execute code line by line, that is, instructions may not run in the sequence that they appear in the code. Async execution can invoke a method and move on to the next line of code without waiting for the invoked function to complete or receive its result.</p><p id="a3fda2e0-b91a-40b3-a031-7baa0d2e5516" class="">Usually, such methods return an entity sometimes called <strong>future</strong> or <strong>promise</strong> that is the representation of an in-progress computation. The program can query for the status of the computation via the returned future or promise and retrieve the result once completed.</p><p id="b05a6997-31c3-4d48-a897-56607093aec0" class="">Asynchronous programming is an excellent choice for applications that do extensive network or disk I/O and spend most of their time waiting.</p><p id="952f5d08-2713-4bec-beeb-33fa240fda48" class="">In non-threaded environments, asynchronous programming provides an alternative to threads in order to achieve concurrency and fall under the cooperative multitasking model.</p><p id="e8bebc18-1b28-4eda-aec8-da0c1f12e0fd" class="">

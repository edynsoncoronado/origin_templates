Such programs primarily depend upon improving CPU speed to decrease program completion time.</p><p id="8947560c-41fb-494a-8f69-fb383db644b1" class="">This could include programs such as:</p><ul id="5e667f1e-292d-48f3-90a9-9cd72c7d2cfc" class="bulleted-list"><li>data crunching</li></ul><ul id="fd8437e8-3128-46cd-a134-0d7f1bee0a4d" class="bulleted-list"><li>image processing</li></ul><ul id="30d05dfe-01a9-481e-8c5a-6e425683daac" class="bulleted-list"><li>matrix multiplication</li></ul><p id="338fecec-5d47-494e-8416-f4d3942b8453" class="">Eventually, there is a limit on how powerful a single CPU can be. At this point, the recourse is to harness the computing power of multiple CPUs and structure your program code in a way that can take advantage of the multiple CPU units available.</p><p id="0b14e7f7-9780-4bcb-93b0-23bbd24da520" class="">Theoretically, the multithreaded program should finish in half the time that it takes for the single-threaded program. However, there will be a slight overhead of creating the two threads and merging the results from the two threads.</p><p id="012e2d6b-43f9-4af6-98b6-8318ec6205d3" class="">Multithreaded programs can improve performance in cases where the problem lends itself to being divided into smaller pieces that different threads can work on independently. However, this may not always be true.</p></li></ul><ul id="6f680fff-aa60-4b67-97d4-159bb61bf59f" class="bulleted-list"><li><strong>I/O Bound</strong><p id="cf707000-b462-489e-b848-9d8ef5aabda5" class="">I/O bound programs are the opposite of CPU bound programs.</p><p id="59f91a16-8823-48a1-aed2-c41a55ccfbe4" class="">Such programs spend most of their time waiting for input or output operations to complete while the CPU sits idle. I/O operations can consist of operations that write or read from main memory or network interfaces.</p><p id="cc3c44cc-ea6d-49e6-9a65-7a98521ff088" class="">This is why I/O bound programs would show relatively lower CPU utilization than CPU bound programs.</p></li></ul><p id="5c184479-2828-4391-b546-2b21dbd3fa45" class="">

For instance:</p><ul id="972ac5be-acac-4a31-acc4-d8b75f5413fc" class="bulleted-list"><li>JavaScript is single-threaded</li></ul><ul id="a0881368-c6ee-44b7-b18a-6a002bd741a0" class="bulleted-list"><li>Java provides full-blown multithreading</li></ul><ul id="cd554242-198d-471d-aa5c-d6917761ad3a" class="bulleted-list"><li>Python is sort of multithreaded</li></ul><p id="01bbe8ad-e724-447d-a84d-45654f997ebc" class="">However, all three languages support asynchronous programming models which is another way for programs to be concurrent (but not parallel).</p><p id="f986a9a2-198f-4e32-a7e2-f12a49b1da89" class="">

<p id="a372a1c5-cdf3-4a2c-910a-fda4eb219af5" class="">For completeness we should mention that there are also memory-bound programs that depend on the amount of memory available to speed up execution.</p><p id="e6077d93-9c63-425f-8706-d2f019a4eb0b" class="">

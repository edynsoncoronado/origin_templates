<p>Routes for our applications, URLs for our application.</p>
<p>The concept is the same one though.</p>
<p>The idea is that we have different paths, which is the part after the domain, so something like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>slash nothing</li>
    <li>slash post</li>
    <li>slash posts, slash something else.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that for these different paths we can trigger different actions.</p>
<div class="text-center">
    <img src="assets_env_image/16.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="..." style="width: 80%;">
</div>
<p>And these actions are our views.</p>
<p>It's the logic that is executed for different URLs.</p>
<p>And we can build them as a function or as a class.</p>
<p>And then there we handle the incoming request and return a response.</p>

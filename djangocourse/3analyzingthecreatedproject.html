    <li>The <strong>asgi.py</strong> and <strong>wsgi.py</strong> files, these files will become important later once we wanna deploy our finished project onto a real server to expose it to the worldwide web.
For the moment we don't need to do anything with these files.</li>
    <li>Now the <strong>settings</strong> file contains a bunch of global settings for this Django project. I will come back to this file from time to time when we need to tweak certain settings.</li>
    <li>Now the <strong>urls.py</strong> file, that is an important file once we start adding more and more pages to our web application, so to say.</li>

<p>We got on migrations folder, and then a bunch of Python files.</p>
<p>Now the migrations folder is basically empty. It will become important again later once we work with databases and models.</p>
<p>Now the <strong>admin.py</strong> file will also become important later, once we start working with the built-in administration area.</p>
<p><strong>apps.py</strong>, here it, for example, gives this a name. We could change this name, but by default it matches the folder name. And this name is needed later to identify this app.</p>
<p>The <strong>models.py</strong> file, will become important once we start working with the database and we add data models to our project.</p>
<p>The <strong>test.py</strong> file will help us with automated testing and unit tests.</p>
<p><strong>views.py</strong> file, that is where we actually will write some logic for determining what we want to show to users to the visitors on our website.</p>

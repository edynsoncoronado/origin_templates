<p>Imagine, that you want to build a static URL where some part of the  URL (e.g. the filename) is actually stored in a variable that's exposed  to the template.</p>
<p>So you might want to build the URL like this:</p>
<div class="code-wrapper">
	<pre>
		<code id="code">
{% static "my_path/to/" + the_file %}
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<p>Here, <strong>"the_file"</strong> would be a variable holding the actual filename.</p>
<p>The above code would fail.</p>
<p>Instead, you can use the <strong>"add"</strong> filter provided by Django to construct this path dynamically:</p>
<div class="code-wrapper">
	<pre>
		<code id="code">
{% static "my_path/to/"|add:the_file %}
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>

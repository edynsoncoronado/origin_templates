<p>Let's now dig in a bit deeper and let's learn a bit more about Django and what we can do with requests and responses and so on.</p>
<p>Python 3.6 dictionaries are by default ordered in Python.</p>
<div class="code-wrapper">
	<pre>
		<code id="code">
>>> a = {'enero': 1, 'febrero': 2, 'marzo': 3, 'abril': 4}
>>> a.keys()
dict_keys(['enero', 'febrero', 'marzo', 'abril'])
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<p>So I can rely on the fact that the first key in my dictionary will be the first item in that list.</p>
<strong>monthly_challenges/challenges/views.py</strong>
<div class="code-wrapper">
	<pre>
		<code id="code">
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse, HttpResponseNotFound, HttpResponseRedirect


monthly_challenges = {
    "january": "Eat no meat for the entire month!",
    "february": "Walk for at least 20 minutes every day!",
    "march": "Learn Django for at least 20 minutes every day!",
    "april": "My birthday",
    "may": "Mother's Day",
    "june": "Father's Day",
    "july": "National Holidays",
    "august": "One more month",
    "september": "Spring is here",
    "october": "Costume party",
    "november": "Christmas is comming",
    "december": "The year is over"
}


def monthly_challenge_by_number(request, month):
    months = list(monthly_challenges.keys())
    if month > len(months):
        return HttpResponseNotFound("Invalid month")

    redirect_month = months[month - 1]
    return HttpResponseRedirect('/challenges/' + redirect_month)


def monthly_challenge(request, month):
    try:
        challenge_text = monthly_challenges[month]
    except:
        return HttpResponseNotFound("This month is not supported!")
    return HttpResponse(challenge_text)
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<p>The response was a 302, which might not tell you much, but which is a redirect response, any response code starting with a three is a redirect.</p>
<div class="code-wrapper">
	<pre>
		<code id="code">
[27/May/2021 00:37:19] "GET /challenges/12 HTTP/1.1" 302 0
[27/May/2021 00:37:19] "GET /challenges/december HTTP/1.1" 200 16
        </code>
    </pre>
</div>
<p>And therefore the browser automatically sent another request to challenges December, since that was the redirect URL we passed with the redirect to the browser.</p>

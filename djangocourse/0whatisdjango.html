<ul>
    <li>Django is a web development framework for Python.</li>
    <li>It allow us to build websites web projects with Python.</li>
</ul>
<h3>But what exaclty is a framework?</h3>
<p>A framework in the end is it's a module, it's a third party library which you install on your system, and the idea is that it has a bunch of utility functionalities, and methods you can use, and that it solves a lot of problems for you so that you don't have to like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>managing sessions</li>
    <li>authentication</li>
    <li>file uploads</li>
    <li>parsing incoming requests</li>
    <li>sending back responses</li>
</ul>
<p>So that you as a developer don't have to focus on those nitty gritty details.</p>
<p>But that instead you can focus on what makes up your website, that you can focus on the core business logic, what earns you money, because you typically don't wanna solve all those site details.</p>
<p>You don't wanna reinvent the wheel all the time, and you don't want to do that techincal side of handling requests and working with the database and managing sessions.</p>
<p>You wanna instead use these tools to then do what your website is about, you nanna decide which data to store and when data should be stored, but you don't wanna implement it techincally.</p>
<p>That's why we use a framework, but it's a framework specifically and not just called a librarry because it does not just give us all these tools to use but it also gives us a clear guidance, a clear set of rules on how to use these tools.</p>

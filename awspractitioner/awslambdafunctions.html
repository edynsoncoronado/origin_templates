<ol>
	<li>Here we have a Lambda function and a developer is going to upload some code. So the developer simply has their own code, uploads it to create a function.</li>
	<li>Now, some event will occur to trigger the function.</li>
	<li>Now, some event will occur to trigger the function. So this could be a CLI event, the API or the SDK, or it could be a scheduled event.</li>
	<li>So the Lambda function executes at a specific point in time.</li>
	<li>When that happens, the code gets executed and you only pay for the time that the code is actually running. So while your code is sitting there in the Lambda function not executing, you're not paying anything. And then it will scale seamlessly based on demand.</li>
